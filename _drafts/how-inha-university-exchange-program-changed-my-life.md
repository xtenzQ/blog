Inha University's exchange program was one of the most exciting experiences. It was my first big trip to a foreign country, and it turned out so well so I want to share my emotions with you.

# How it started

During my master's degree program I got an opportunity to participate in the university content to win a scholarship to a Finnish university and spend one year as an exchange student. But after a bit of research on what classes are available and how much the standard of living I decided it's too expensive despite the scholarship. And thanks to the international office of my university I was offered some Korean universities, and one of them was Inha University located in Incheon.

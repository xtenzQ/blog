Actually, after spending two hours setting up rclone and then configuring a service on startup, I found out KeePassXC can’t load the .kdbx from the mounted point. Seems like it’s required to copy the db file from the mount to local storage so google-drive-ocamlfuse is really a way since it does everything for you. Let’s start.InstallationJust follow the official docs:Install with:sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alessandro-strada/ppasudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install google-drive-ocamlfuseAuthorize to Google Drive running this command for the first time:google-drive-ocamlfuseCreate the mount point:mkdir ~/mygoogledriveMount the filesystem:google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/mygoogledriveTo speed up the ocamlfuse, try increasing value of metadata_cache_time from 60 to 600 in the config file:vim ~/.gdfuse/default/configCopy your .kdbx to your Google Drive, and open it in KeePassXC.Enjoy! :)" }, { "title": "Fixing BSOD while running BigNox and WSL", "url": "/posts/wsl-and-emulators/", "categories": "development", "tags": "dev, wsl, linux, windows", "date": "2020-09-13 20:42:00 +0000", "snippet": "Today I have encountered a problem related to running android emulators and Windows Subsystem Linux which was not mentioned in BigNox BSOD repairing tutorial.
